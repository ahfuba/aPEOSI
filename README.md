## ahfuba's Python Emulated Operating System Interface

A Python based DOS/OS Simulator, made for fun and understanding WHY Python is really unfit for programming such applications that require process speed, which allows users to execute commands or run applications without the limitation of the OS.

It also is a project to understand the fundamentals of the front-end of an OS.

This is a fun project. It needs a computer with an already installed operating system; and also a Python installation.
