## ahfuba's Python Emulated Operating System Interface

A Python based DOS/OS Simulator, made for fun and understanding WHY Python is really unfit for programming operating systems/kernels that require less consumption of system resources, which allows users to execute commands or run applications without the limitation of resources.

It also is a project to understand the fundamentals of the front-end of an OS.

This is a fun project. It needs a computer with an already installed operating system; and also a Python installation.

### Why?

Well, at first I was going to program something similar to "simulator"s you see on Scratch, or a Windows Simulator/Starter you see on Android. Which, is either just a fancy "file explorer", thus not being fit for the name of an OS Simulation; or a simulation made in a game engine with only the graphical elements and some basic functions, again not being fit to be a complete OS simulation in my opinion. 

Therefore, I went and decided to program something sees a `\disks` folder from Windows (or any other OS you are using) file system as Devices/Disks connected to the "virtual" computer. (Well, this isn't a virtual machine, so it's just going to inherit the system information of your own computer) You will be able to change the disk/device type by editing a config file inside the folder.

There is a base kernel that works, not same, but similar to a kernel. The model I was inspired was Windows NT, because it was more of a closed ecosystem than Linux kernel (please don't execute me Arch fans) which was perfect for such a project.

Well, I actually got this "kernel inspiration" idea by asking. I certainly don't know what I am doing or why I am doing this. So... um... yea.

<!--### How does it work?

The way it works is, first and foremost, carcinogenic. Python is a high-level language, making it REALLY heavy and resource-intensive, which makes this simulation WAY slower than a simulator written in C, C++, or any other low- to mid-level language.

When you first run setup.bat, it runs setup.py (duh). This adds an `A` disk (OS disk) and a `BOOT` disk. Thatâ€™s all it adds. You expected more? Great. Lick your palm.

Then, it basically clones the GitHub repo into this A disk, in a folder called `"apeos"`, and, similar to Windows creating an MBR partition on your disk, it also creates another partition called `"C:"`, and a `"Windows"` folder under the disk `"C:"`, allowing the notation `"C:\Windows"`. With the same logic, a file location in Windows would be: `<folder you put the setup in>\disks\A\newfolder\blabla.bla`, meanwhile in aPEOSI, it would be: `A:/newfolder/blabla.bla`.

When installed correctly using the `setup.bat`, you will be able to run the OS simulation in a windows by running `py/python/pythonX apeosi.py`, running the OS.
